    review1: "This is my third Invicta Pro Diver. They are just fantastic value for money. This one arrived yesterday and the first thing I did was set the time, popped on an identical strap from another Invicta and went in the shower with it to test the waterproofing.... No problems.",
    review2: "It is obviously not the same build quality as those very expensive watches. But that is like comparing a Citroën to a Ferrari. This watch was well under £100! An absolute bargain.",
